                <h2>Travel And Vacations</h2>
                <p>This past year has been really fun for me as my family has gone on many vacations. Just 2 weeks ago we returned from Iceland. I really enjoyed it as it was extremely pretty and it really showed the natural beauty of the earth <br>
                It was awesome to see all the waterfalls, all the hot springs and different culture as well as the very clean environment. We also went to Minneapolis in Minnesota in late may, which I also enjoyed as we were visiting my uncle. <br>
                When we were in Minneapolis it was nice to see all the activism supporting BLM as the tragic shooting of George Floyd in May 2020 occured. We also took a vacation to Palm Springs, California in April which was really funm, as its an oasis <br>
                this means that the weather is very hot because it is surronded by desert. And last but not least my personal favorite vacation was when we went to Florida in December 2020. We go yearly to visit my cousins and i enjoy it alot :).<br>
